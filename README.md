# Abstract
It is a platform where the user can *share* his/her contemplation, thoughts, ideas, images or other stuff **completely anonymously**, eliminating the need of any third person i.e. Admin.

# Background
Almost every college maintains Public Pages on at-least one or more Social Media Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for anonymous sharing of any underlying thought, idea or confession. To share something anonymously a person has to e-mail the Admin of Public Page and then Admin shares the post anonymously on the Page. 
The problems with this approach are:
1.	Admin may disclose the **identity** of the person.
2.	Admin may take some time to post.
3.	Dependence on the third-party platform.
4.	Maintenance of the page.
5.	No way to **report sensitive content**.
6.	Blocking any user.
7.	Users can not edit or change their post once it's shared.
